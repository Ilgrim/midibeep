midibeep.rb: Convert a Standard MIDI (.mid) file into Spectrum BEEP statements
http://github.com/gasman/midibeep/

Installation / requirements
---------------------------
You will need Ruby, and midilib:
    gem install midilib

You probably also need something to translate BASIC text files into something
that can be loaded into a Spectrum; I use zmakebas
    http://www.svgalib.org/rus/zmakebas.html
but for Windows, BASin probably works well:

Usage
-----
    ruby midibeep.rb my_midi_file.mid
will dump the BEEPs to standard output;
    ruby midibeep.rb my_midi_file.mid > my_program.txt
will send the output to somewhere more useful. Or, for command-line-fu fans:
    ruby midibeep.rb my_midi_file.mid | 

Limitations
-----------
- The algorithm for condensing down to one channel is pretty crude. Don't
  expect good results if you feed it a full orchestral score.
- The output format is a memory hog. Expect to get about 1500 lines into 48K.
